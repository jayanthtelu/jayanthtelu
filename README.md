#### ðŸ”­ Projects I Worked On..! 
Sentimental Analysis on Tweets                                                                                                                  April 2023    
- The project involves scraping tweets from the University of Maryland, College Park on Twitter using specific hashtags. The text data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure high-quality input. Feature extraction is done using bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches to capture patterns and associations. A sequential neural network model is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of an embedding layer, LSTM, CNN, GRU, and dense output layers. Performance evaluation is conducted using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess sentiment classification effectiveness. The project aims to gain valuable insights into the sentiment landscape of University of Maryland, College Park tweets, providing a deeper understanding of public sentiment in this context.

Netflix Demographics                                                                                                                                           Dec 2022
- Iâ€™ve gathered the Netflix datasets from â€˜kaggle.comâ€™ and cleaned the data in this project. The data is transformed according to the requirements for exploratory data analysis. Using the transformed datasets, Iâ€™ve developed visualizations using Tableau. These visualizations give a clear understanding of the complete datasets. These visualizations are integrated into a webpage using the streamlit framework and hosted the webpage on this page. (https://rb.gy/cdhqtl)

EDA on COVID-19                                                                                                                                              April 2022
- In this project, weâ€™ve chosen the centralized repository of up-to-date and curated datasets related to the spread and characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated illness, COVID-19. The COVID-19 data lake consists of data from different around the globe from various organizations. From all the available data such as testing data, vaccinations data, hospital data, and about many more events regarding COVID-19 we have chosen the testing data which has up to November 2021. Using this dataset, our main goal is to identify the trends of positive cases of the covid-19 around the country and track the death polls of COVID-19 in various regions. Also, try to forecast the cases of a week ahead using various packages.

Identifying and Predicting Customer Churn                                                                                                                     Sep 2020
- In this project, I've gathered data sets from a home improvement company and cleaned all the data that is required for exploratory data analysis. After cleaning, I've made some hypotheses related to customer churn and their behavior. Then I did some analysis on the data and got some insights into the data, then converted those insights into visualizations which helped to identify the root causes of the problem.

An efficient keyword search and dynamic updation over encrypted data in the cloud.                                                                Sep 2019 - April 2020
- In this project, we implemented an efficient multi-keyword ranked search. Here we use the effective RSA Algorithm to encrypt the contents of the file. We also implemented dynamic updating of data into the files that are already on the cloud, enhancing the user experience by making the application more user-friendly.
